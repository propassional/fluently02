# BEWARE
# Git does not accept backslashes, even if working on windows
# The "/" at the end of the path indicates clearly that it is a directory, so it will be accepted but it is less clear
# The paths must be relative to the repo root position
# If Git has already committed a folder, .gitignore wonâ€™t remove it from tracking.

# BEFORE COMMITTING
# Check that there are no nested .git folders: cmd>dir /a /s /b .git | findstr /i /v /x "%cd%\.git"

# Logfile > 600 KB should not be put into the repo, but this condition is not supported,
