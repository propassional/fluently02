The file \Intents_2024_11_28__16_22_54.json has been created automatically, using the FLExtractIntentFromYAMLPerState.py module 
It contains all possible user interaction alternatives, for each SM state

The user can select following alternatives:
1) Select within states or jump states of the state machine
2) Select other tabs, containing other state machines
3) Select a few EBuddy buttons (e.g. autopilot)

Note: I removed the settings intent: since we decided not to command by voice the settings button content, we do not open it by voice
