################## Release 1.1 Requests (to be possibly done until 30.4 at 13:00) ##################

Ordered by priority:

x Switch tab: use tab names and not only GoToRight/Left, so that the user can also jump

x In whatever SliceScan SM state, SaveHighPosition nor SaveLowPosition are triggered (but I can trigger them from EBuddy debug cockpit, simulating their call)
		
x Vocal commands for moving the mouse (for example for rotating the workpiece in Artec Studio)
	Command structure: verb / direct object / adverb or adjective etc)
	move mouse over the desk: move mouse right / left / up / down
	press mouse buttons: press mouse left / middle / right / 
	release mouse buttons: release mouse left / middle / right / 
	rotate mouse rotary wheel: rotate wheel forward / backward

x Bug: Rocco Registration>ToolsMenuIsOn dico StartAutoMenu, NLU capisce StartToolsMenu 
	=> E' deterministico, error occurred: FLCommands.command_file_archive() missing 1 required positional argument: 'attribute'

x Generic transitions, Rocco proposal so that the user can move in a state machine: up/down/left/right
