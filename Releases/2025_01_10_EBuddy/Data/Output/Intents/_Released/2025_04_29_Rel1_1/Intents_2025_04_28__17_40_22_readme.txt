The file \Intents_2025_04_28__17_40_22.json has been created automatically, using the FLIntentExtractFromYAMLPerState.py module
I updated manually that file to Intents_2025_04_29__10_17_23, adding the jump states as transitions only, not as states

The json file contains all possible user interaction alternatives, for each SM state, except GotoTabRight, GotoTabLeft

The user can select following alternatives:
1) Select within states or jump states of the state machine
2) Select other tabs, containing other state machines: ['Preview', 'FullScan', 'SliceScan', 'Registration', 'CommandHub']
3) Select some EBuddy GUI buttons: ['AutopilotOn', 'AutopilotOff']

Note: I removed the settings intent: since we decided not to command by voice the settings button contents, for consistency we do not open it by voice
