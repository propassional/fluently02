The file \Intents_2025_05_02__14_12_35.json has been created automatically, using the FLIntentExtractFromYAMLPerState.py module 
It contains all possible user interaction alternatives, for each SM state, excluded GotoTabRight and GotoTabLeft

The user can select following alternatives:
1) Select within states or jump states of the state machine
2) Select other tabs, containing other state machines: ['Preview', 'FullScan', 'SliceScan', 'Registration', 'CommandHub']
3) Select some EBuddy GUI buttons: ['AutopilotOn', 'AutopilotOff']

Note: I removed the settings intent: since we decided not to command by voice the settings button contents, for consistency we do not open it by voice
