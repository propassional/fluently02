The file \Intents_2025_05_06__12_49_14.json has been created automatically, using the FLIntentExtractFromYAMLPerState.py module 
It contains all possible user interaction alternatives, for each SM state

The user can select following alternatives:
1) Select within states or jump states of the current state machine
2) Select other tabs, containing other state machines: ['Components', 'Preview', 'Recording', 'FullScan', 'SliceScan', 'Registration', 'CommandHub']
3) Select EBuddy GUI buttons or tab change commands: ['PreviousSlide', 'NextSlide', 'Okay', 'SkipSlide', 'DetailedSlide', 'ThumbUp', 'ThumbDown', 'ILike', 'IDislike', 'GoToTabLeft', 'GoToTabRight', 'AutopilotOn', 'AutopilotOff']

Note: I removed the settings intent: since we decided not to command by voice the settings button contents, for consistency we do not open it by voice
