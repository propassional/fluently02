Just add here a new app dir and its .png in the same structure as the other apps, the app name will be automatically detected

Insert the app name into the code, so that focus_set_on_app results ok: screenshot_search

Do not insert .PNG!!

Do not insert the same transition name in two different apps (probably problematic)

In Do add:
FocusIsOnAppNameDo.png
FocusNotOnAppNameDo.png
