Problem: 
On 8.4.25 PySimpleGUI did not work anymore, right after trying to import it it asks for a key, giving the error: "license key validation failed"
Since now, I never had to license pycharm community nor PySimpleGUI
Error gave this link: https://docs.pysimplegui.com/en/latest/

Solution:
Use an older version, that you can find in 
D:\Banfi\Github\Fluently\Releases\2025_01_10_EBuddy\PySimpleGUI_4_60_5-main
It has been installed in C:\Users\operator\.conda\envs\ml_env\Lib\site-packages:
