- I create a series of "preview" images, but never is detected when running Sikulix, while the internal inspector detects it! Why this??
=> This folder has no concrete improvings :-(

From GA version, I changed this:
- time_sleep_main_loop = 3 => 5 for having less stress interacting with the PC when Sikulix is running
- New EIZO monitor
- Sikulix now sees two screens, since video output is now on two monitors
