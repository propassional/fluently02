Here's an example of how you can use a regular expression in PyCharm to search for lines that contain both "event" and "close":
1. Open the search functionality (Ctrl+F for current file or Ctrl+Shift+F for project-wide search).
2. Click the regex icon to enable regular expression mode.
3. Enter the following regular expression in the search field:

(?i)^.*event.*close.*$|^.*close.*event.*$

This regex will match any line that contains both "event" and "close" in any order.
Let's break down the regex:
- The `(?i)` at the beginning makes the entire regex case-insensitive
- `^` : Start of the line
- `.*` : Any character (except newline) zero or more times
- `event` : The literal word "event"
- `.*` : Any character (except newline) zero or more times
- `close` : The literal word "close"
- `.*` : Any character (except newline) zero or more times
- `$` : End of the line
- `|` : OR operator
- The second part after `|` is the same pattern but with "close" and "event" swapped, to catch lines where "close" appears before "event"

This regex will match lines like:
- "The event was closed successfully."
- "Close the event after the participants leave."
- "Event handler for close button clicked."
- "Closing the event prematurely is not recommended."
